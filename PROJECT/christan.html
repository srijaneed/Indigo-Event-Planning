                    Wedding reception ideas for a Christian marriage are not always that different from any wedding, 
                    but you do have an opportunity to honor God and shine the light of Jesus in your reception–just as 
                    you did in your wedding.

                    Wedding receptions are a time-honored tradition for newlywed couples to celebrate their new marriage, 
                    enjoy the company of their guests, and show their appreciation to their family and wedding party.
                    
                    After the wedding ceremony, wedding vows and the wedding sermons, it’s time for the wedding reception!
                    
                    Over time, many traditions have evolved for the wedding reception. For a Christian couple, some of 
                    these traditions should be done away with, while others can be transformed with the help of your 
                    event planner Seattle to have new meaning. And for a Christian couple, there are new traditions to 
                    consider adding that will honor Christ and shine his light and love to your guests.
